## 🔧 What We Do

### 1. Technical Media & Education
- Research-grade blog posts on LLM architectures, vector search, and safety alignment (via [Medium](https://medium.com/@cosinelab))
- Short-form video explainers on TikTok and 小红书 for hands-on tutorials and demos
- Open-source notebooks demonstrating advanced LLM applications (e.g. RAG, QLoRA, prompt injection testing)

### 2. Open Tooling
- 🧰 `cosine-eval`: lightweight evaluation toolkit for LLM generations  
- 📚 `prompt-hub`: curated prompt and system message templates for production use  
- 🧵 `rag-bench`: benchmark suite for retrieval-augmented generation pipelines across Faiss, Pinecone, and Milvus

### 3. Engineering Services
- 📐 LLM system design: scalable retrieval, fine-tuning, and orchestration blueprints
- 🔄 Rapid prototyping: build & deploy AI-powered features using LangChain, LlamaIndex, and Hugging Face
- 🔍 Evaluation: hallucination scoring, toxicity/risk detection, and in-domain alignment testing
